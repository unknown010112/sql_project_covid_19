🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration

📌 Introduction

This project explores COVID-19 data using SQL. The dataset includes COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations, allowing for various analyses to understand trends and patterns.

📖 Background

The dataset is obtained from public COVID-19 data sources and structured within a MySQL database. It includes two main tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. The project aims to analyze infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress worldwide.

🔍 The Analysis

Exploring the dataset: Extracting relevant columns such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population.

Total Cases vs Total Deaths: ⚰ Calculating the likelihood of death if infected.

Total Cases vs Population: 🏥 Determining the percentage of infected individuals per country.

Countries with the Highest Infection Rate: 🌎 Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

Countries with the Highest Death Count: 💀 Finding countries with the highest COVID-19 death toll.

Breaking Down by Continent: 🌍 Analyzing continents with the highest death count per population.

Global Numbers: 📊 Summarizing total cases, deaths, and mortality rate.

Total Population vs Vaccinations: 💉 Using rolling sums to track the number of vaccinated individuals.

Using CTEs and Temporary Tables: 🏗 Performing calculations using advanced SQL techniques.

Creating Views: 🖥 Storing processed data for future visualizations.
